# Community-Youtube
An electron or web app for watching YouTube videos together in-sync. Featuring easy customization of the order of videos in the queue. Public or Private video queues. Larger community queues. Music Queues that are auto generated from leading top 100 chart services (Spotify, Billboard 100, etc.)

# Planned Features
I have lots of exciting things planned for this app and I cannot wait to start knocking them out first things first I have to setup Electron to work :( which has been a pain in the past.

## Parties
Create parties to watch video with friends and easily manage who can post to the current playlist queue, or who can upvote / downvote videos.
React to videos that are currently playing to help them get placed in community playlists.

## Medals
Earning medals is a fundamental part of this app aside from parties. You will earn medals by watching videos while in a party with at least one friend. Having more friends watching means earning more medals faster! Now you have all these medals after watching a [24 hour stream of Nyan Cat][Nyan Cat], what do you do with them all!?


## Spending Medals
Introducing the medal store, a place to spend currency after hours of watching videos with your friends. You will be able to purchase a host of items that improve your experience on {{App Name Here}}. 
* Video Player Skins
* Special Video Reacts
* Purcahse special event tokens
* Increase Playlist queue size

## Events and Challenges
I plan on hostly weekly and monthly {{Punny App Name Event Here}} events that invovle getting large groups of people together to watch videos. During events extra medals will be given out and extra special prizes. Speaking of 24 hour Nyan Cat videos, who remembers those silly challenges to watch the whole video? Well I plan on bringing back YouTube video challenges with world party events.

## Mini-Viewer
Who doesn't like having a mini pop up window to watch their YouTube queue with their friends? With {{App Name Here}} mini view you can watch while you right that 20 page essay, or studying, or studying for your 20 page essay.
